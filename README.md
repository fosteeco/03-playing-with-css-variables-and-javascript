# Project 3 playing with css variables and JS

Interesting project. My first time seeing css variables being modified through javascript.

Live Preview: https://fosteeco.github.io/03-playing-with-css-variables-and-javascript/

Accomplished through this setting:

```
document.documentElement.style.setProperty(
`--${this.name}`,
this.value + suffix
);
```
